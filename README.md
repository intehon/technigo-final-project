# technigo-final-project

My final project for Technigo Bootcamp.

_I want to create a website for my current workplace - restaurant Woodstockholm. The main reason why people visit the site is to get information about the restaurant, see the current menu, book a table, sign up for newsletters and get in touch with us._

_I want to add a function where we who work at Woodstockholm should be able to register as a user and log in to upload the current menu and new pictures etc._

_As for stretch goals I want the staff to be able to leave comments for improvements on the website that we can process internally._

_Another thing that would be cool is if I could implement my wine API from the previous weekâ€™s so that when we have a wine matching (with one of the reviews from winemag.com) in our wine list, that review would show up in under that particular wine._
